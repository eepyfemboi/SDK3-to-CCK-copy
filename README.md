# SDK3-to-CCK-copy
the unity script from https://fluffs.gumroad.com/l/sdk3-to-cck that converts vrchat avatars to chilloutvr. i reuploaded it here because for some reason its not available to download over there anymore.

im planning on making my own converter script based on this one eventually

also, i found out that to convert a unity 2022 project u can just import the cck into unity 2022 and try to ignore the errors, or at least that worked for me, idk

this repository is intended to provide a helpful tool that it seems cannot be obtained from the original source. it is not inteded to "steal" or take credit for anyone else's work. if you are the original creator of this tool and you want me to remove this repository, create an issue and i'll take it down
